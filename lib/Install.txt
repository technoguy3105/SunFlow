SunFlow Installation
====================

SunFlow requires the following steps before usage:

	1) copy sunflow.py into your library directory
	2) Update your system path to this directory

Both steps are describe here.

1) Copy the file sunflow.py into your library directory. If there is no such directory, create one - for example /py/libs/ and copy sunflow.py into this directory.   
   
2) Ensure that the path to the library directory can be found by python at the time of import. The easiest way is adapting your path-variable. If this doesn't work or is not apllicable, you should copy aitpath.py first into your python directory 

	/python3.7/site-packages/IPython/extensions

and adapt afterwards the file aitpath.py to your requirements. To do so, set the variable sys_user in function sysUser() to your operating system's user name - for example 'peter' - and add this path to the system's path by

	sys.path.append('/users/'+sys_user+'/Py/libs')

The final definitions inside aitpath.py after modifications could look as follows:

	def sysUser():
    	   platform = operatingSystem()
    	   return 'peter'

	sys.path.append('/users/'+sys_user+'/Py/Libs')

The functions sysUser() must be kept, since it is required by SunFlow.
